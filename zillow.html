<div class="innertube"><b>Content Column: <em>Fluid</em></b> <p> Testing the middle column. I give you a small excerpt from a blog post I enjoyed from <a title="Zillow's Engineering Blog" href="http://engineering.zillow.com/paparazzi-charts/">Zillow's Engineering Blog"</a>. </p><p>Charts are a really important part of the content on Zillow. We generate a lot of complex and interesting data about homes, and charts help our users visualize and understand it. One of our most important metrics is the <a title="Zillow Home Value Index" href="http://www.zillow.com/blog/research/2012/01/21/zillow-home-value-index-methodology/">Zillow Home Value Index</a> (ZHVI), which is used throughout our services, and has also appeared in <a href="http://www.zillow.com/blog/research/recent-collaborations/">several academic studies</a> and <a href="http://www.zillow.com/blog/research/2011/09/20/zillow-chief-economist-testimony-on-glut-of-foreclosures/">Congressional testimony</a>.  Here&#8217;s an example chart of the Zestimate of a home, the ZHVI in the zipcode, and the ZHVI in the city, over time.</p>
<p><a href="http://engineering.zillow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/paparazzi_chart2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-314 aligncenter" src="http://3.z-engineering.diverse-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/662x324xpaparazzi_chart2.png.pagespeed.ic.PnDPQXJAJG.png" alt="" width="662" height="324"/></a></p>
<p><span id="more-217"></span>Over the years, we&#8217;ve experimented with several approaches to putting charts in the browser, ranging from pure server side rendering, to Flash, to cross-platform Javascript. In the end, we&#8217;ve settled on a hybrid implementation that optimizes for both speed and interactivity. Here&#8217;s how it works. First, we render a chart on the server as a PNG. Then, when the client downloads that PNG, we use a bit of Javascript to create interaction on top of the PNG.</p>
<p>The reason this works well is that we do the heavy CPU lifting on the server side to render the chart, using a Javascript charting library. Client browsers can request just the PNG of the chart for the smallest possible payload or grab a JSONP (<a href="http://www.json-p.org/">http://www.json-p.org/</a>) response that contains both the chart image and interaction meta-data in the same payload. A tiny 20KB client side script can grab the JSONP version and layer a scrub line and legend on top to provide basic client side chart interactions.</p>
<p>Drawing charts server side is a little odd these days. Drawing charts on the server side using Javascript, then returning the result as a PNG is just plain weird. But, it&#8217;s a good kind of weird.</p></div>

<div id="leftcolumn">
<div class="innertube"><b>Left Column: <em>180px</em></b> <p> Testing the left column. For testing the left column, I present some jokes currently going around the internet.</p>

<p>It's hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally.</p>

<p>I'd tell you a UDP joke, but you may not get it; or I could tell you a joke about TCP, but I'd have to keep repeating it until you got it, so I prefer IP jokes; it's all in the delivery.</p>

<p>Werner Heisenberg, Kurt Gödel, and Noam Chomsky walk into a bar. Heisenberg turns to the other two and says, "Clearly this is a joke, but how can we figure out if it's funny or not?" Gödel replies, "We can't know that because we're inside the joke." Chomsky says, "Of course it's funny. You're just telling it wrong."</p>

<p>Pavlov is sitting at a pub enjoying a pint, the phone rings and he jumps up shouting "oh shit, I forgot to feed the dog!"</p>

<p>Einstein, Newton and Pascal are playing hide and seek. Einstein closes his eyes and counts to 100. Pascal runs off and hides. Netwon draws a one meter by one meter square on the ground in front of Einstein, and stands in the middle of it. Einstein opens his eyes, and sees Newton immediately, exclaiming, "Newton, I found you! You're it!" Newton smiles and says, "You didn't find Newton, you found a Newton over a square meter. You found Pascal!"</p>

<P>A photon checks into a hotel and the porter asks him if he has any luggage. The photon replies: “No, I’m travelling light.”</p>

<p>How many surrealists does it take to screw in a light bulb? A fish.</p>

<p>Never trust an atom. They make up everything.</p>

<p>The barman says: “We don’t serve faster-than-light particles here.” A tachyon enters a bar.</p></div>

<div id="rightcolumn">
<div class="innertube"><b>Right Column: <em>200px</em></b> <p> Testing the right column. For testing the right column, I present The Jaberwocky.</p>
<p><br />
"<b>Jabberwocky</b>"<br />
<br />
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br />
<br />
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br />
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br />
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br />
The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br />
<br />
He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br />
Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br />
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br />
And stood awhile in thought.<br />
<br />
And as in uffish thought he stood,<br />
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br />
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br />
And burbled as it came!<br />
<br />
One, two! One, two! and through and through<br />
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br />
He left it dead, and with its head<br />
He went galumphing back.<br />
<br />
"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br />
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br />
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"<br />
He chortled in his joy.<br />
<br />
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
